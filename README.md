# Impact-of-Eating-Habits-on-Obesity-with-R

## Overview
Obesity is a significant public health concern. It is associated with an elevated risk of multiple adverse health outcomes, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. Obesity also has sizable economic and social implications. Studies show that medical costs for people with obesity in the U.S. tend to be 30% to 40% higher than those for people without obesity 1 . Poor dietary habits constitute a primary contributor to obesity and a body of research consistently reveals that diets high in calories, saturated fat, and added sugars are strongly linked to heightened obesity risk. Consequently, gaining a deeper comprehension of the connection between eating habits and obesity can empower individuals to make more informed decisions regarding their dietary and lifestyle choices.

This study investigates the influence of some eating habits on individual’s obesity levels while accounting for demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and family history of obesity. Leveraging a set of regression models based on data about respondents’ dietary habits and demographic information, we estimate the changes in BMI(body mass index) and ultimately gather insights about the dietary habits that significantly influence the likelihood of obesity.

## Introduction
In this project, my team and I used the publicly available Obesity data through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We deployed large-sample linear regression models and apply the models on held-out data to investigate the impact of eating habits on obesity in R. Specifically, we used p-values and robust standard errors to measure the significant of the independent variables over the dependent variable. 

Additionally, we discussed the limitations of our study primarily due to the synthetically generated data and the possible endogeneity bias, and the effect of the bias on our analysis of the outcome. 

## Conclusion

Based on our findings, we should encourage individuals to avoid frequently consuming high-caloric food, drink more than 2L of water a day, and avoid drinking alcohol. However, this is only a single study and it only serves to provide some guidance for future research. The aim of this study is to examine which eating habits have significant influence on an individual’s BMI so people with higher BMI’s know where they should focus their efforts to becoming healthier.

We use R to generate a [PDF report](https://github.com/zukangy/Impact-of-Eating-Habits-on-Obesity-with-R/blob/main/report_pdf/lab_2_report.pdf) which will provide a full explanation of our methodology and analysis.
